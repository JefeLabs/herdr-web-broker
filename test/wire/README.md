# Wire tests

Live probes against a real herdr. NOT part of `npm test` — they need a
running broker + herdr instance and the real CLIs installed. Run one with:

    HERDR_WIRE=1 node --test dist/test/wire/paste.wire.js

`tsconfig.json`'s `include` covers `test/**/*.ts`, so `npm run build`
compiles and type-checks every file here under `strict` right alongside the
real suite — a wire test that stops type-checking fails the build even
though it never runs. `npm test`'s glob is `dist/test/**/*.test.js`, which
`*.wire.js` doesn't match, so these build without running; the
`{ skip: !process.env.HERDR_WIRE }` guard on each test is belt-and-braces
on top of that, for anyone who points `node --test` at the whole
`dist/test` tree directly.

Each answers a question this design could not verify offline. Record the
answer in the spec's wire-truth table and, where it is a per-CLI fact, as a
`[[cli.profiles]]` row in `config.toml` — not as new reader code.

| id | question | if it fails |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WT-1 | does `pane.send_input` bracket multi-line paste? | every multi-line prompt through the broker splits on newlines and submits early — a BUG FIX, not a config row |
| WT-2 | does `agy --conversation <fresh-uuid>` mint that id, or reject it? | agy stays on cwd-map + `startedAt` discovery |
| WT-3 | ~~`opencode export` output shape~~ **ANSWERED 2026-08-27** — opencode's real store is `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` (SQLite+WAL); a finished assistant turn carries `time.completed`, and `session.directory` makes cwd discovery a SQL predicate | — |
| WT-4 | codex `rollout-*.jsonl` terminal record shape | codex stays on the status tier |
| WT-5 | copilot `session-store.db` schema | copilot stays on the status tier |
| WT-6 | does herdr's `pane.exited` carry an exit code? | agent-death cause stays unreported (the exec endpoint is unaffected — it reads its own `; echo $?` drop file, not `pane.exited`) |

WT-3's answer already shipped and needs no probe: `src/cli-profiles.ts`'s
`opencode` profile (`via: "sqlite"`) and `src/transcript.ts`'s
`parseOpencode`.
